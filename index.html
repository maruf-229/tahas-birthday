Even though distance separates us, my thoughts are wrapped around you like a warm embrace. You are the light of my life, the beat of my heart, and the reason I smile every day. May this birthday bring you endless joy, just as you've brought infinite happiness to me.</p>

            <h2>Our Beautiful Story</h2>
            <p>We've been together since July 19, 2025 – that's over 6 months of pure magic, even across continents. We've faced the challenges of long-distance, time zones pulling us apart, and moments of missing each other terribly, but we've stuck together like stars in the night sky, unbreakable and shining bright.</p>

            <p>Every video call, every message, every shared dream has strengthened our bond. I can't wait for the day we close this gap forever.</p>
