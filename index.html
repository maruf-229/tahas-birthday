                my thoughts are wrapped around you like a warm embrace. You are the light of my life...<br>
                the beat of my heart... and the reason I smile every day.<br><br>

            <h2>Our Beautiful Story</h2>
            <p>We've been together since July 19, 2025 . That's over 6 months of pure magic, even across continents.
                We've faced the challenges of long-distance, time zones pulling us apart, and moments of missing each
                other terribly, but we've stuck together like stars in the night sky, unbreakable and shining bright.
            </p>

                <p>“Even when the map shows thousands of miles between us, my heart only knows one address — yours.”</p>

            </blockquote>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>“Time zones try to steal our moments, oceans try to keep us apart, but every night when I close my
                    eyes, you're already in my arms. Happy birthday, my forever home.”</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Every video call, every message, every shared dream has strengthened our bond. I can't wait for the day
                we close this gap forever.</p>
